# Security Researcher
### Ben (AlienTec) 👋

I’m a cybersecurity professional and developer with a strong focus on offensive security, exploit development, and creating innovative open-source solutions. My work combines hands-on technical expertise with a passion for strengthening digital security.

## 🏗️ Current Research & Development

**Project: Advanced Automated Recon & Initial Access Framework**

I am currently architecting a modular security framework designed to bridge the gap between reconnaissance and initial access through intelligent automation.

*   **Recursive Intelligence:** Implementing deep-dive scanning logic that automatically re-evaluates new findings to map the entire attack surface.
*   **Full-Spectrum Recon:** Automated discovery of subdomains, services, and hidden assets with integrated vulnerability mapping.
*   **Initial Access Evaluation:** Developing logic to identify and validate potential entry points, streamlining the transition from recon to exploitation.
*   **Status:** In active development / Alpha stage.
