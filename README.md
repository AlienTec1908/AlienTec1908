# Ben (AlienTec) 👋

I’m a cybersecurity professional and developer dedicated to scaling red team operations through modular, logic-driven solutions. My work focuses on the convergence of manual tradecraft and automated heuristics, combining hands-on technical expertise with a passion for innovative open-source exploit development.

## 🏗️ Current Research & Development

**Project: Advanced Automated Recon & Initial Access Framework**

I am currently architecting a modular security framework designed to bridge the gap between reconnaissance and initial access through intelligent automation.

*   **Recursive Intelligence:** Implementing deep-dive scanning logic that automatically re-evaluates new findings to map the entire attack surface.
*   **Full-Spectrum Recon:** Automated discovery of subdomains, services, and hidden assets with integrated vulnerability mapping.
*   **Initial Access Evaluation:** Developing logic to identify and validate potential entry points, streamlining the transition from recon to exploitation.
*   **Status:** In active development / Alpha stage.

> *"The goal is to automate the noise so I can focus on the complex exploits."*
